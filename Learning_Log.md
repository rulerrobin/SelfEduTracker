# 2022 Learning Log

### July 13

Came back from holiday and settling in back home with getting everything ready and complete for new schedule which I plan to start by August. What I'm doing learning wise today is setting up for The Odin Project. Which I plan to do after I listen to the first few classes of CS50.

I have decided on which bootcamp I will be doing, which will be the slightly longer Coding Academy bootcamp 9 months course. This is because while it's longer, it has more course reviews and background from what I have researched in SWE web development. It also has the 1 month placement if needed though I hope to find a job with a portfolio from the course and myself by then.
