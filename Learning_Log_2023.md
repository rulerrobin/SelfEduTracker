## Summary

I was supposed to start a bootcamp late last year however I had things to personally take care of and because of that I was unable to start it, it was also for data science and analytics. The new course is in software engineering and I realised I need structure to complete the work as well. I think I still want to do data analytics though to be honest but we'll see.

  **March 15:** Decisions have been made and I am going to study full time 6 months at Coder Academy while at the same time doing the curriculum I set out for myself, by doing this I will hopefully be able to stand out as a prospect for hire as well as being able to use the staff for my own projects that I have listed out on the other page.
   
  **March 31:** So in the course I have chosen I have started with terminal, getting used to git again and being able to do some basic things in HTML and CSS. Overall I am enjoying having the pressure of keeping up and having goals as well as the structure of classes and assignments. I have started working on the first assignment which is essentially just questions to complete however my main focus is to do the practical classes and assignments to complete projects and personal projects for a portfolio.

  **April 3:** I organised my schedules for the next term as well as personal projects in Notion, in doing so I have realised I basically have no time for much else due to the speed of the accelarated course and I am keeping up by staying ahead of the classes and assignments thus far. However I am not sure if I am able to keep this up when it gets to the harder topics. This week I am learning about layouts, responsive designs and flexboxes. I have also completed some questions of the workbook assessment and set up a moodboard for my basic portfolio website.

  **Aril Summary:** I actually did not end up updating this during April howevr I completed a general assessment in which I created a basic web page for a portfolio website that I am alright with. I realised during this time how important time was to schedule everything and reading the rubric as I got the only thing I got marked down for except for tidbits such as coding practices such as, Anchor links should not be child elements of button elements and dates not being included as I did not read some of those things when making it. Also the PPT needed to be more detailed even though I thought it was for presentation in the rubric it required more detailed information. Overall good experience so far but have fallen a bit behind due to a Melbourne Trip and need to catchup. 

  I also submitted the workbook which usually I don't do great in but I learned alot about fundamental concepts and history of programming.

  **May 5:** Currently working on the final project of Term 1, it's a basic terminal application. My plan is to implement a basic CLI RPG adventure with static rooms and events in reach room. Planning it out now and I'm deciding how much of the gameplay loop I'll actuallyu be planning out in flowcharts or how I'm planning it. I've got a basic Notion Kanban board set up with basic general to do list which I will likely expand over the next few days.

  Considering data analytics still more than software engineering but we'll see how it all goes.
