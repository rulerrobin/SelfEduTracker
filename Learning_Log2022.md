### June 2022

So far in June of 2022 I have done a lot of research into different courses and strategies people have used to switch into SWE from all walks of life and a key factor that I have seen in these other than project work of course is foundational courses, a core course they used to begin with and then moving onto freecodecamp and working through certifications. I have updated the course_log accordingly to what I think will be beneficial for me to learn and go through and will continue to do so.

### _22 June 2022_

Re opened my old github accound and made a sort of blog/tracker for a future portfolio of my skills and the road I am taking to become a SWE. Took a while to figure out why markdown was not working but have got a barebones set up going.

### _23 June 2022_

Decided to do TOP as it will help more than programming in a real environment and I can practice basic things using Code Academy if I need to.

### July

### _July 13_

Over the course of my holiday I considered the difference between Coder Academy and Institute of Data hosted by UTS. I decided to go with Coder Academy for my course as from my research it has many more reviews and history in regards to SWE (Web Dev). I found it much harder to find information about the SWE course for IOD as it looks to be mostly Data Science, which I would love to try but I want to get back into SWE and creating in coding. Only caveat to that though is that it is longer by 3 months due to class length and things covered. I also chose Coder Academy as it has a 1 month placement if needed and also covers python which I would like to learn. Though the institute of Data has 5 students per teacher I believe from reviews and people I have spoken to, I believe Coder Academy covers the technology I want to use and is a good place to learn.

I started doing The Odin Project introductions which is mostly about what is a computer.
