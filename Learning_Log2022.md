### June 2022

So far in June of 2022 I have done a lot of research into different courses and strategies people have used to switch into SWE from all walks of life and a key factor that I have seen in these other than project work of course is foundational courses, a core course they used to begin with and then moving onto freecodecamp and working through certifications. I have updated the course_log accordingly to what I think will be beneficial for me to learn and go through and will continue to do so.

Re opened my old github accound and made a sort of blog/tracker for a future portfolio of my skills and the road I am taking to become a SWE. Took a while to figure out why markdown was not working but have got a barebones set up going.
