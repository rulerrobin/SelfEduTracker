So far in June of 2022 I have done a lot of research into different courses and strategies people have used to switch into SWE from all walks of life and a key factor that I have seen in these other than project work of course is foundational courses, a core course they used to begin with and then moving onto freecodecamp and working through certifications. I have updated the course_log accordingly to what I think will be beneficial for me to learn and go through and will continue to do so.

### _June 22_

Re opened my old github accound and made a sort of blog/tracker for a future portfolio of my skills and the road I am taking to become a SWE. Took a while to figure out why markdown was not working but have got a barebones set up going.

### _June 23_

Decided to do TOP as it will help more than programming in a real environment and I can practice basic things using Code Academy if I need to.

Over the course of my holiday I considered the difference between Coder Academy and Institute of Data hosted by UTS. I decided to go with Coder Academy for my course as from my research it has many more reviews and history in regards to SWE (Web Dev). I found it much harder to find information about the SWE course for IOD as it looks to be mostly Data Science, which I would love to try but I want to get back into SWE and creating in coding. Only caveat to that though is that it is longer by 3 months due to class length and things covered. I also chose Coder Academy as it has a 1 month placement if needed and also covers python which I would like to learn. Though the institute of Data has 5 students per teacher I believe from reviews and people I have spoken to, I believe Coder Academy covers the technology I want to use and is a good place to learn.

I started doing The Odin Project introductions which is mostly about what is a computer.

### _July 14_

Started working on Prequisites of the course in Foundations learning about how the Web works and also finally figured out and understood how Packets work and the internet works with transferring Data which is actually amazing going through different pathways each to get their locations.

### _July 17_

Watched Lecture 0 of CS50, however I will be skipping using scratch as I a have some previous basic experience in programming and have TOP for coding already in practice. Once coding in a dev software starts in CS50 I will follow along and do the projects.

### _July 19_

Continued work on the start of TOP and continued on the Unix lesson which I started last week however had a permissions error on my mac. After some troubleshooting and "repair" of terminal permissions I think my issue was actually a typo in the terminal code.

### _July 20_

Continuing to work on TOP Unix lesson as I complete it during work and travel time. My manager suggested a data analyst role for me from the contact centre which has me questioning what I should do next as I can learn quickly if that is my main focus so I might try to apply to it for now and see how it goes.

### _July 21_ 

I am nearing the end of the Unix lesson and feel like I have learned a lot, understanding a bit of the CLI in how to manage (move, delete, copy, etc) files/directories.

In todays lesson I am learning about pipes to create outputs from multiple commands without making an intermediary file. My answers in the lessons so far have either been close to the answer or I misread the question so although I missed some I feel more confident than I do before. Watched Part of CS50 Week 1 and could not finish it because I was too tired.

### _July 22_

Continued watching CS50 Week 1 but still unfinished, will continue and finish tomorrow
