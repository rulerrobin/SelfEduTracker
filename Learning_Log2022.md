  So far in June of 2022 I have done a lot of research into different courses and strategies people have used to switch into SWE from all walks of life and a key factor that I have seen in these other than project work of course is foundational courses, a core course they used to begin with and then moving onto freecodecamp and working through certifications. I have updated the course_log accordingly to what I think will be beneficial for me to learn and go through and will continue to do so.

  ### _June 22_

   Re opened my old github accound and made a sort of blog/tracker for a future portfolio of my skills and the road I am taking to become a SWE. Took a while to figure out why markdown was not working but have got a barebones set up going.

  ### _June 23_

   Decided to do TOP as it will help more than programming in a real environment and I can practice basic things using Code Academy if I need to.

   Over the course of my holiday I considered the difference between Coder Academy and Institute of Data hosted by UTS. I decided to go with Coder Academy for my course as from my research it has many more reviews and history in regards to SWE (Web Dev). I found it much harder to find information about the SWE course for IOD as it looks to be mostly Data Science, which I would love to try but I want to get back into SWE and creating in coding. Only caveat to that though is that it is longer by 3 months due to class length and things covered. I also chose Coder Academy as it has a 1 month placement if needed and also covers python which I would like to learn. Though the institute of Data has 5 students per teacher I believe from reviews and people I have spoken to, I believe Coder Academy covers the technology I want to use and is a good place to learn.

  I started doing The Odin Project introductions which is mostly about what is a computer.

  ### _July 14_

   Started working on Prequisites of the course in Foundations learning about how the Web works and also finally figured out and understood how Packets work and the internet works with transferring Data which is actually amazing going through different pathways each to get their locations.

  ### _July 17_

   Watched Lecture 0 of CS50, however I will be skipping using scratch as I a have some previous basic experience in programming and have TOP for coding already in practice. Once coding in a dev software starts in CS50 I will follow along and do the projects.

  ### _July 19_

   Continued work on the start of TOP and continued on the Unix lesson which I started last week however had a permissions error on my mac. After some troubleshooting and "repair" of terminal permissions I think my issue was actually a typo in the terminal code.

  ### _July 20_

   Continuing to work on TOP Unix lesson as I complete it during work and travel time. My manager suggested a data analyst role for me from the contact centre which has me questioning what I should do next as I can learn quickly if that is my main focus so I might try to apply to it for now and see how it goes.

  ### _July 21_ 

  I am nearing the end of the Unix lesson and feel like I have learned a lot, understanding a bit of the CLI in how to manage (move, delete, copy, etc) files/directories.

   In todays lesson I am learning about pipes to create outputs from multiple commands without making an intermediary file. My answers in the lessons so far have either been close to the answer or I misread the question so although I missed some I feel more confident than I do before. Watched Part of CS50 Week 1 and could not finish it because I was too tired.

  ### _July 22_

   Continued watching CS50 Week 1 but still unfinished, will continue and finish tomorrow
  
  ### _July 23_

   I am now 25% through the foundations part of The Odin Project and set up Git/nearly done with basics and completed basic prerequisites. My next step is to get into HTML Foundations and go from there. I still have not finished Week 1 lecture of CS50 but will try again tomorrow when we return home.
  
  ### _July 25_
  
  Monday is the day Week 1 of CS50 was finished, and I have also had trouble with making the SSH key as I made one with TOP already a few days ago. I am not sure what happened to the old one so I have asked TOP discord and am now waiting for a reply as I don't want to mess things up yet and mess around too much.
  
  ### _July 26_ 
  
  So with my SSH issue it's fine it just wrote over my previous one and I will probably look into this more at a later time as I am still unsure how exactly SSH keys work with different keys, accounts and access after researching them. I watched CS50 Lecture 2 today and realised I have not completed Problem set 1 from the previous.
  
  For TOP I have actually started the HTML foundations section and am starting to do basic HTML, no issues so far.
  
  ### _July 27_
  
  I am now working on problem set 1 and am able to print out the # but it all comes out as a line of whatever is inputted and repeats. I am having trouble making it so that it appears as a pyramid type shape. Still trying to troubleshoot this and have to do week 2 problems/lab as well after this.

  <summary> August </summary>
  
  ### _August 1_
  
  After this past month I have realised after covering some general basics that it might be easier and more beneficial to focus more on one language as if I eventually do decide to get into data analysis/science and machine learning which are all interesting topics I might as well start with Python and see where I go from there.
  
  The reason I am choosing Python is because as a language it will be easier to learn and faster to learn with less syntax and code overall but still being versatile and having many different uses. I am still going to go through with CS50 however am putting The Odin Project on hold as I travel down basics and fundamentals of Python then following along in projects from FreeCodeCamp and getting into making my own projects right after.
