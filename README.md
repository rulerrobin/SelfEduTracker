# SelfEduTracker
Tracker of my knowledge base through online learning as I transition into SWE. I am planning to have a learning log in which I put my learnings as I go through the days of any breakthroughs and troubles I have, essentially like a blog as I go through courses and projects. 

The reason I am making the switch into SWE is because I have some experience in HS and University doing it however due to a bad experience in one class decided to step away and follow other interests in communications and media which I love and still have passion for. However I want to get back into the tech space and build projects so this whole repository is my tracker and transition diary for my change.
